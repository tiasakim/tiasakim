- 👋 Hello! I’m Tiasa [tee-AY-suh] (she/her), a PNW native and recent B.A. Computer Science graduate from Wellesley College.
- 👀 My brain is *driven* with curiousity by urban / future mobility, decarbonization, and human-centered innovations.
- 👩🏻‍💻 Call me a work enthusiast! Lately I'm developing the webpage for [MIT Global Startup Workshop 2023](gsw.mit.edu) and working at MIT Energy Initiative as an EdX Online Course Developer for [11.449 Decarbonizing Urban Mobility](https://dusp.mit.edu/classes/decarbonizing-urban-mobility-1).
